This code snippet demonstrates a common error in PHP related to improper handling of array keys when using array functions like `array_keys()` or `array_values()`.  The problem arises when dealing with arrays where keys are not strictly numerical and you rely on the ordering of elements after using these functions.

```php
<?php
$data = [
    "apple" => 1,
    "banana" => 2,
    "cherry" => 3
];

// Get array keys
$keys = array_keys($data);

// Get array values
$values = array_values($data);

//Attempt to access elements based on original key order, which is not guaranteed.
foreach($keys as $i => $key){
echo "Key: " . $key . ", Value: " . $values[$i] . "\n";
}
?>
```
This might seem to work fine, but the order of elements in `$values` is not guaranteed after using `array_values()` unless your original keys are contiguous numerical indexes starting from 0.  Therefore, you might get different value than what is expected.
